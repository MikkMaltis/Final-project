# Final-project

Mikk Maltis final-project TAK-22

1. 2D videogame with Unity or Godot.

Description for game: It is either top-down shooter, platformer or tower defense game. 

2. CS2 nade lineups for different maps.

Description for app: If you want to get better at CS2 & you want to learn new nade lineups, without going to Youtube & searching every specific lineup for ages, there can be app for it. Most definitely Android Studio will be used for it, because IOS needs some kind of license to put apps to their store.

So, it starts with map selection display, there are 7 different active duty map pool maps, these are pretty much most popular maps in the game at the moment. When you click on one of the maps, it displays "Choose side", it means that you need to choose either terrorist or counter-terrorist side, because they could have very different lineups. At the bottom of the page there is button that has text "Go back", it means you can get back to the start/home display.
